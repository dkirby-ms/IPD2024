## **Lab 1 - Computer vision in action**

### **Introduction to Computer Vision**

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data from the world. By leveraging advanced algorithms and models, computer vision systems can perform tasks such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition. Common computer vision models include [YOLO (You Only Look Once)](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/), which is known for its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection, and [ResNet (Residual Networks)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), which excels in image classification tasks. Azure provides robust tools for computer vision through [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-vision/), which allows developers to build and deploy object detection models tailored to their specific needs. Azure AI Vision enables the detection and identification of objects within images, making it easier to analyze visual data and gain actionable insights, thereby enhancing the capabilities of applications across various industries.
